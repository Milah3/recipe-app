# Recipe App

[Go to site](https://recipe-app-eew.pages.dev/)

I'm actually really proud of how this project turned it. I was able to learn a lot about how to retreive data using the fetch and asynchronously use it in your code.
It's pretty epic. :).

# What does it do?

It's a website that retreives JSON data from the food API then displays the data onto the webpage so you can cook your favorite recipe! Also does search functionality as well as utilizes asynchronous/await functions.

# Final thoughts

There's still lots of features that can be added, but this project has taught me a lot and I leave it with a better understanding of how to write and use asynchronous functions than before.

# Thanks

Thanks to @Florinpop17 for his youtube tutorials that helped me accomplish this!
